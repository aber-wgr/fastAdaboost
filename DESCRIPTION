Package: fastAdaboostDoD
Type: Package
Title: DoD Variant of fastAdaBoost
Description: Based on Sourav Chatterjee's fastAdaboost. Implements Adaboost based on C++ backend code, redesigned for Data Oriented Design principles.
             This is blazingly fast and especially useful for large, in memory data sets. 
             The package uses decision trees as weak classifiers. Once the classifiers
             have been trained, they can be used to predict new data. 
             Currently, we support only binary classification tasks.
             The package implements the Adaboost.M1 algorithm and the real
             Adaboost(SAMME.R) algorithm.
